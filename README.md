### Tools and Run

This project was built using Visual Studio Code. To edit this project, is recomended to use the *Open folder* from Visual Studio Code.

- Java 8


In the project directory, to install dependencies you can run:

- ### `yarn`

- ### `yarn android`


#### Build Enviroments
In the app two environments were developed to run the application, API and MOCK. The MOCK environment performs requests and receives responses with false but functional data for the project. The API environment performs requests and receives responses through the firebase by performing HTTP requests to the server, bringing real and dynamic data simulating a real use of the project.

To set app enviroment you should change the file : (./src/services/ServiceDataSource.js)

```
  constructor(mockDatasource, apiDataSource) {
    this.BUILD_TYPE = BUILD_TYPES.API // on BUILD_TYPES you can use MOCK or API enviroment .
    this.mockDatasource = mockDatasource
    this.apiDataSource = apiDataSource
  }
```

PS: To run project on API build type you need define .env variables to firebase credentials .
